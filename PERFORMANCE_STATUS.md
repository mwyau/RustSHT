# RustSHT performance checkpoint — current findings

**Active sequence (2026-10-22):** the scalar-analysis cumulative ablation is
closed; Plan 16 is active at Milestone C. Plans 14 and 15 are complete. Plan 17
is queued; Plans 12 and 13 remain deferred. **Branch:**
`opt/sht-performance-parity`.

## Scalar-analysis cumulative ablation

Production remains on staged output, the checked range-proof cache, and the
fixed 256 reflected-pair tile. The original `ce710` baseline, fixed workspace
layout, packed reduction, range-cache control, direct-output path, and
cumulative 64/128/256-tile variants were compared. The packed reduction and
layout change lacked supported whole-transform gains; 64/128 tiles were
slower; direct output was 2.42–2.81× slower in the final matrix and violated
cold/warm reset consistency. The no-cache route was 25–40% slower. See the
[closeout report](reports/scalar-analysis-cumulative-ablation-2026-10-21.md)
and [sanitized final matrix](reports/data/scalar-analysis-cumulative-ablation-2026-10-21/final-combined/README.md).

## Plan 16 — spin-1 recurrence and dataflow

Milestone A's executed-path crosswalk and matched stage profile are in
[the crosswalk](reports/plan16-spin1-executed-path-crosswalk-2026-10-22.md).
Milestone B tested fused two-channel and one-channel parity-separated
recurrences. Neither improved whole transforms. One-channel removed YMM spills
but duplicated recurrence, regressing q1 synthesis about 23%; q8 was neutral
to slower. Production remains unchanged. See the [A/B report and data](reports/plan16-spin1-parity-separated-ab-2026-10-22.md).

**Next:** quantify paired-coefficient preparation calls, bytes, worker time,
and wall-time contribution across ring groups. Prototype bounded prepared
coefficient reuse only if those measurements justify its memory and validation
cost. Keep converted scalar-row caching distinct; it is already implemented.

## Other measured context

The completed scalar GL T64–T256 dispatch diagnosis attributes the q8 analysis
cliffs to compact-table selection and serial row FFT eligibility, not a recent
source regression. The current policy uses recurrence for q8 exact-grid
analysis and a 4096-sample scalar GL row-FFT work floor. T124 full q8 analysis
improved from 2.52–2.75× to 0.68–0.95× DUCC. The remaining full-order
T248–T256 synthesis gap is about 1.15–1.45×. See the [diagnostic report](reports/scalar-t64-256-performance-discontinuities-2026-10-21.md).

Plan 15's GL→CC→F1 sequence is complete. Its remaining CC/F1 synthesis excess
was attributed to recurrence/spectrum work; tested dataflow candidates did not
justify another production kernel. See the [Plan 15 closeout](reports/plan15-spin1-synthesis-dataflow-closeout-2026-10-21.md).

**Constraints:** preserve strict Rust floating-point semantics, checked
exceptional-value fallbacks, portable Pulp SIMD, the stable API, and the
odd-length FFT hold. Keep DUCC 0.42.0 pinned at
`42ce8ab5c5d79e0e2fd9af4a09c2ea4693520e1b` for current comparisons.
